THE ANCIENT SCROLLS: a Linux BASH-run command line note-taking app.

This application takes text and screenshots, and stores them as JSON files.
It is written in the Go language, version  go1.19.8 linux/amd64.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLATION:

1) create a folder to contain the run file
2) create a file within that folder called scrolls-init.go and save that file.
3) run by using the command go run scrolls-init.go
4) a more permanent executive file can be created by using the command go build scrolls init.go
       That file can be run with the command ./scrolls-init
